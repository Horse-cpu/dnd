Its interior is divided into two floors, with a Ladder running along one wall to connect them. The Ladder ends at a trapdoor leading to the roof. When activated, the tower has a small door on the side facing you. The door opens only at your Command, which you can speak as a bonus Action. It is immune to the knock spell and similar magic, such as that of a Chime of Opening.\n\nEach creature in the area where the fortress appears must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw, taking 10d10 bludgeoning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. In either case, the creature is pushed to an unoccupied space outside but next to the fortress. Objects in the area that arent being worn or carried take this damage and are pushed automatically.\n\nThe tower is made of adamantine, and its magic prevents it from being tipped over. The roof, the door, and the walls each have 100 Hit Points, immunity to damage from nonmagical Weapons excluding siege Weapons, and Resistance to all other damage. Only a wish spell can repair the fortress (this use of the spell counts as replicating a spell of 8th Level or lower).

The cylindrical space within the hole exists on a different plane, so it can't be used to create open Passages. Any creature inside an open portable hole can exit the hole by climbing out of it.\n\nYou can use an Action to close a portable hole by taking hold of the edges of the cloth and folding it up.

A breathing creature within a closed portable hole can survive for up to 10 minutes, after which time it begins to suffocate.\n\nPlacing a portable hole inside an extradimensional space created by a bag of holding, handy haversack, or similar item instantly destroys both items and opens a gate to the Astral Plane.
